 Control access to Apps
========================


Allows to configure administrators which don't have access to Apps.

Adds **Apps access** selection in user's access rights tab. Two options are available: 

* *Allow installing apps*
* *Allow installing apps only from settings*

Note: During porting to 12 version, a bug was detected with the selected option "Allow installing apps only from settings" (A user could not open a menu [[ Sales ]] >> Configuration >> Settigns). The error has not been fixed yet.
